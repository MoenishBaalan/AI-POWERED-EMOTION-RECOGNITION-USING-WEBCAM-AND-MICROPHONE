# AI Emotion Recognition Using Webcam and Microphone

##  Overview
This project implements a **real-time AI-based emotion recognition system** by fusing **facial expression analysis** from webcam video and **speech emotion analysis** from microphone audio. The system continuously captures video and audio inputs, processes them independently, and identifies the user's emotional state.

The project demonstrates how **multimodal emotion recognition** improves accuracy and reliability compared to single-input systems.
