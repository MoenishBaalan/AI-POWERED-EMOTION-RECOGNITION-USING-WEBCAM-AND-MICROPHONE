  Real-time Emotion Detection using Webcam and Microphone <br/>
  <i><b>Multimodal AI | Audio-Video Fusion</i></b>
</p>

---

##  Overview
This project implements a **real-time AI-powered emotion recognition system** that analyzes  
**facial expressions** via webcam and **speech signals** via microphone.

By combining **visual and audio modalities**, the system delivers more reliable emotion predictions  
compared to single-source emotion recognition approaches.

---

##  Objectives
- Capture live facial expressions using a webcam  
- Analyze speech emotions from microphone input  
- Process audio and video streams in parallel  
- Fuse both modalities to determine the final emotion  
- Display emotion results in real time  

---

##  System Workflow
1. Webcam captures live video frames  
2. Facial emotions are detected using computer vision  
3. Microphone records audio samples  
4. Audio features are extracted for emotion analysis  
5. Audio and video are processed simultaneously  
6. Final emotion is derived using fusion logic  
7. Emotion output is displayed on screen
